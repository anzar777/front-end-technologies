            <b> The tree of life is a fundamental archetype in many of the world's mythological, religious, and
                philosophical traditions. It is closely related to the concept of the sacred tree.[1] The tree of
                knowledge
                connecting to heaven and the underworld such as Yggdrasil and the in Genesis, and the tree of life,
                connecting all forms of creation, are both forms of the world tree or cosmic tree,[2] and are portrayed
                in
                various religions and philosophies as the same tree.[3]

        <p><b> a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after
            flowering (see Fruit anatomy).

            Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible
            fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic
            relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact,
            humans and many other animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Consequently, fruits
            account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the
            pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.</b> </p>

            A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a
            combinator.

        <section>
            <p> The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>

        <p>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

        <p>Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".</p>
