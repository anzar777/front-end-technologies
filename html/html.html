            <h2>caste politics</h2>

            In <i>India</i> , a <em>caste</em> is a (usually endogamous) <strong> social group where membership is decided by birth.</strong>[1] Broadly,
            Indian castes are divided into the Forward Castes, Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled
            Tribes. Sometimes Indian Christians and Indian Muslims may also function as castes (a full list of castes
            can be found at the end of this article). With castes separating individuals into different social groups,
            it follows that each group will have conflicting interests; oftentimes putting those with lower social
            standing in less favorable positions. An attempt to address this inequality has been the reservation system,
            which essentially acts as affirmative action to provide representation to caste groups that have been
            systematically disadvantaged. There have also been other cases where political parties, like the Bahujan
            Samaj Party (BSP), was formed to challenge the power of the upper castes.

            The role that castes play in India's political system was institutionalised by the British colonist where
            upper-caste dominance within government was perpetuated and reinforced. Although there were efforts to
            address this discrepancy through measures like the Communal Award and educational empowerment (see
            ‘Sanskritization’), this remained the status quo until the 1990s when an economic liberalisation in India
            diminished state control and fueled the rise of caste-centric parties focused on empowering lower castes.
            However, these parties were often rife with corruption as it was seen as a way to level the playing
            field.[citation needed] Leaders of what came to be known as 'caste mafia' took advantage of lower caste
            dissent towards upper caste institutions and openly robbed state institutions.[citation needed]

            Caste not only determines one's role in political institutions; it also influences access to resources like
            land as well as police and judicial assistance.[citation needed] Despite the traditional dominance of upper
            caste parties, the concentration of lower caste individuals in specific areas can lead to regional
            dominance, impacting political representation. However, this mainly impacts male members of the lower castes
            as women from lower castes have traditionally been excluded from participating in the political
            sphere.[citation needed] This discrimination has continued in recent times as women from lower castes are
            continued to be looked down upon for their low educational levels. Organizations such as the Gulabi Gang as
            well as the United Nations are currently working to improve lower caste women's social mobility and
            independence.

            <h2>history</h2>

            Historically,[2] it has been very hard to change the structure of caste politics in India. More
            recently[when?] however, there has been a flux in caste politics, mainly caused by economic liberalisation
            in India. Contemporary India has seen the influence of caste start to decline. This is partly due to the
            spread of education to all castes which has had a democratising effect on the political system. However,
            this "equalising" of the playing field has not been without controversy. The Mandal Commission and its
            quotas system has been a particularly sensitive issue.
            <br>
            <h2>Colonial history</h2><br>
            Main article: British India

            The British institutionalised caste into the workings of the major government institutions within India. The
            main benefactors of this indirect rule were the upper castes or forward castes, which maintained their
            hegemony and monopoly of control and influence over government institutes long after independence from the
            British. The state of post-colonial India promised development, rule of law, and nation building, but in
            reality, was a complex network of patronage systems, which solidified the upper-caste position of dominance
            over civil service institutions. This network undermined the very promises of 'nation building' that
            post-colonial India had made and ushered in an area of upper-caste dominance that lasted for the next four
            decades.

            In August 1932, the then Prime Minister of Britain, Ramsay MacDonald, made what became known as the Communal
            Award. According to it, separate representation was to be provided for communities such as the Dalit,
            Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians and Europeans. These depressed classes were assigned a
            number of seats to be filled by election from special constituencies in which only voters belonging to these
            classes could vote.
