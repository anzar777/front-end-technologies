        <h2>apple</h2>
        <p>One of the most popular fruits, apples are chock-full of nutrition.
            They’re rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, such as pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. These help
            you manage your blood sugar levels, promote good digestion, and support gut and heart health.</p>

        <h2>blueberries</h2>
        <p>Blueberries are well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
            In particular, they’re high in anthocyanin, a plant pigment and flavonoid that gives blueberries their
            characteristic blue-purple color. This compound helps fight cell-damaging free radicals that can lead to
            disease. </p>

    <div class="colomn3">
        <h2>bananas</h2>
        <p>The benefits of bananas go beyond their potassium content. Along with providing 7% of the Daily Value (DV)
            for potassium, bananas contain (15Trusted Source):

            Vitamin B6: 27% of the DV
            Vitamin C: 12% of the DV
            Magnesium: 8% of the DV
            In addition, they offer a wide variety of plant compounds called polyphenols and phytosterols, both of which
            support your overall health. Furthermore, they’re high in prebiotics, a type of fiber that promotes the
            growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.</p>
